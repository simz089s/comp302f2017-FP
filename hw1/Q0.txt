Scenario 1:
  It could be argued that too much detail was given by both parties. Bob and Tom
  were too specific about their problem and Hanna gave back the exact answer
  instead of simply giving hints. Bob and Tom are already in teams of two.

Scenario 2:
  Once again, they are all at fault. Tom for obviously plagiarising, but also
  Bob and Anne for not protecting their work by putting it in a public
  repository.

Scenario 3:
  Matt and Abbey, who aren't in the same team, are mainly at fault. Abbey for
  giving the solution, especially the exact code, and Matt for taking it. John
  could also be argued for not having checked that the code wasn't plagiarised,
  but Matt could've hidden it. Unfortunately they are still in the same team
  so Matt jeopardised John's credibility and studies by doing so.
